# Nebulae

This repository contains the code of Nebulae which is unoffcial open source GUI client for [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com). It uses the same API as GOG Galaxy and is intended to be an alternative to it (or the only option for platforms that are not supported by GOG Galaxy atm, like Linux).
It's still WIP, so if you came for a Galaxy-tier app - please, be patient :)

	- browse store (✅),
	- view store product information (description, details, reviews...) (✅),
